<type>(<scope>): <subject>

The components of a conventional commit message are:

<type>: Describes the purpose or category of the commit.
It can be one of the following types (although you can define your own types if needed):

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, indentation)
- refactor: Code refactoring without adding new features or fixing bugs
- test: Adding or modifying tests
- chore: General maintenance or other changes that don't fit into the above categories

<scope> (optional): Indicates the module, component, or section of the codebase that is affected by the commit.
It helps provide context about the commit.

<subject>: A brief and concise description of the commit's purpose.
It should be written in the imperative mood and not include a period at the end.
